# LoreTogether

Created for the Reddit and Kiro Community Games Challenge

**LoreTogether** is an interactive storytelling platform built on Reddit's Devvit platform where stories come alive through your choices! This innovative app allows users to create and experience personalized, choice-driven narratives with dynamic page counts (1-10 pages). Every decision you make gets seamlessly woven into the story using smart placeholder replacement, creating a unique reading experience that's different for every person.

## What Makes LoreTogether Innovative

- **Magic of Choice Integration**: Watch your decisions automatically appear throughout the story using special `{{tags}}` - choose "fire" as your element and see it woven seamlessly into every page where `{{element}}` appears
- **Dynamic Story Creation**: Build stories with 1-10 pages using an intelligent two-step form that adapts to your chosen page count, with built-in validation for choice consistency
- **Interactive Tutorial System**: New users experience a hands-on tutorial that demonstrates how personal choices, dynamic text replacement, and community polls work together
- **Community-Driven Outcomes**: Stories end with polls where ALL readers vote together on what happens next, creating shared narrative experiences and community engagement
- **Real-time Community Feedback**: See live voting results with percentages and vote counts as the community shapes future story directions
- **Creator-Friendly Interface**: No technical knowledge required - intuitive forms guide you through creating complex interactive narratives with choice validation and placeholder management
- **Reddit Native Integration**: Built specifically for Reddit, enabling seamless sharing, commenting, and community discussion around interactive stories
