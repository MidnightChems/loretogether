# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing story creation form to support personal choices (PC) that can be referenced later in the story. Personal choices allow story creators to add interactive decision points where readers select options (like choosing a color, name, or preference) that get dynamically inserted into subsequent story pages using placeholder syntax.

## Glossary

- **Personal Choice (PC)**: An interactive decision point in a story where readers select from predefined options
- **Story Creation Form**: The existing Devvit form used to create new story posts
- **Placeholder Syntax**: Template variables in story text using `{{variable}}` format that get replaced with user choices
- **Story Creator**: The user creating a new story through the form
- **Story Reader**: The user reading and interacting with the published story
- **Form System**: The Devvit showForm API and related form handling logic
- **Backend API**: The server-side `/api/create-story` endpoint that processes form submissions
